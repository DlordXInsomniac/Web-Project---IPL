# Web-Project---IPL

This a project based on IPL teams 2022.
The web-page is designed using HTML & CSS, and the functionalities using javascript.

The homepage show a card-based grid of all the teams. 
On the team card, the click takes the user to the team details page.

● Team Details Page has following information:

   ○ Team Name

   ○ Team Icon

   ○ Player Count

   ○ Top Batsman

   ○ Top Bowler

   ○ Championship Won Count

   ○ Card grid with all the players.
   
   Player card has the following information:

   ➢ Full Name

   ➢ Photo

   ➢ Team

   ➢ Price

   ➢ Playing Status - Playing or On-bench

   ➢ Role - Batsman, Bowler, or All-rounder.

Player card click takes to the player details page. 

The Player details page has the same details as the card but with a different design(I made it like popup :) ).

That's it upto now. There is no backend yet.

Feel free to modify the project.
